# BOSCH280

## Overview
BOSCH280 is an ESP8266 nonOS SDK module designed for interacting with BOSCH i²c sensors, specifically the BME280 and BMP280. These sensors are widely used for environmental monitoring, providing data such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.

The project includes source code to support these sensors, as well as an example project for easy integration.

## Branch Information
- **Main branch:** Contains the source code for interfacing with the BME280 and BMP280 sensors using the ESP8266 nonOS SDK. The code allows for sensor data reading and I²C communication, with a focus on efficient and optimized performance for IoT applications.
- **Example branch:** A complete example project demonstrating how to integrate and use the BOSCH280 module in a real-world setup. This branch serves as a hands-on guide for developers looking to quickly implement sensor reading and monitoring.

## Features
- **ESP8266 nonOS SDK Support:** Specifically designed to work with the ESP8266 microcontroller. The nonOS SDK provides a lightweight operating environment, making it suitable for real-time operations and small, single-task applications like sensor readings and data transmission in IoT devices.
- **I²C Communication:** Facilitates communication with BOSCH BME280 and BMP280 sensors via the I²C protocol.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Enables data acquisition of temperature, humidity, and pressure for IoT and embedded systems applications.
- **Example Project:** Provides a full working project setup for developers to experiment and integrate the module seamlessly.
